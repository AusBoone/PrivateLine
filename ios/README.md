# iOS Client (SwiftUI)

This directory contains a minimal SwiftUI client for the PrivateLine backend. It demonstrates basic user authentication and message exchange with the Flask API.

## Getting Started

1. Open the `ios` folder in Xcode.
2. Ensure the Flask backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`.
3. Build and run the app in the iOS simulator.

The app includes a simple login screen and a chat view. After logging in, messages can be fetched and sent using the API service.
